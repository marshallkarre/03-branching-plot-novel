Peer’s project: Karre's 03-branching-plot-novel

 

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?

 It was interesting seeing how different someone else's code can look like.

What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 He gave the player the option to quit the game during the game.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 When you want to start a new line you don't have to use another print statement. Just place \n where you want a new line to start. Also you can use a backslash (\) before an apostrophe if you need to use a conjuction and it won't interfere with the print statement.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Everything was clear and easy to read. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 It took me a bit to understand that the story was written from bottom to top.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Everything is simple and well organized.
